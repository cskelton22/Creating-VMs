- For resource group, choose your recent resource group you just created. Create a name for your new virtual machine.

  - For your region, choose whichever region you want to create your virtual machine in.

  - For size, choose whatever size of memory you would like to use. *Be aware of the cost of the size, for the bigger the size, the more of your free credit will be used. Generally, I would choose the basic defualt plan or the cheapest 2 vcpus.

- Create a username and passowrd. *Remember your Username and Password, because you will need it to connect to your VM.

- At the bottom of the page, click "I confirm" for the "Licensing" portion, and then select "review & create".

- Once you see validation passed, click "create" to create your first virtual machine!

  - Wait a few moments for your virtual machine to fully create.

 - Once your virtual machine is created, open your virtual machine. Look for your public IP address in the "Overview" section. Click "copy to clipboard" to copy your IP address, because you will need it to connect to your virtual machine.

- In this video, I will be demonstrating on how to connect to your virtual machine by using the public IP address given in Azure.
